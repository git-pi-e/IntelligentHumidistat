# Intelligent Humidistat
This repository contains all the files relevant to the 'An Intelligent Humidistat' project that were made in partial fulfillment of the Microprocessors &amp; Interfacing Course at BITS Pilani. The files consist of a driver assembly code file and design files from Proteus.

## System Description: 

A humidistat is supposed to be reset according to the outside temperature - as the 
outside  temperature  falls,  the  humidity  level  inside  the  house  should  be  set  lower.  The  purpose  of  this  
project  is  to  develop  a  humidistat  which  senses  the  outside  temperature  and  adjusts  the  humidity 
accordingly. Two sensors are required: outside temperature and inside humidity. Output is provided via a 
simple  relay  with  the  humidifier  (presumably  on  the  furnace)  being  on  or  off.    Also  readings  from  the  
humidity and temperature sensors must be displayed on an LCD display. The entire system can be turned 
on or off using a single switch.
